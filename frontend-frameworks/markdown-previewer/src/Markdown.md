# Structured documents

Sometimes it's useful to have different levels of headings ot structure your
documents. Start lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row
denote smaller heading sizes.

## This is a second-tier heading

You can use on `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

If you'd like to quote someone, use the > character before the line:

I think you should use an `<addr>` element here instead.
```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```
```python
def foo():
  if not bar: 
    return True
```
